**Note from Coder**: I have tried to make it in a simple fashioned folder/directory structure for ease of use for beginers, easy to perform personal tweaks and modifications. Although I am working on making a clean modular structure for more practicality and power.

This is a prototype build, with new features yet to be added in the future! >_
